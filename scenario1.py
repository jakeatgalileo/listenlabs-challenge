# Scenario 1: Two symmetric attributes with equal minCounts (e.g., young and well_dressed).
# Requested policy:
# - Phase A (both below min): accept anyone with at least one attribute; reject neither.
# - Phase B (one met, other not): accept only candidates who have the unmet attribute (including both-true);
#   reject single-attribute candidates from the group that has already met its minimum, and reject neither.
# - Phase C (both met): accept all to minimize rejections.
# - Always enforce feasibility: if rejecting would make it impossible to reach a min, force-accept; if a person
#   does not have a critical attr and rejecting them would make it impossible, force-reject.


# Removed older feasibility helpers that are no longer referenced by the
# current phase-based strategy to keep the module lean.
